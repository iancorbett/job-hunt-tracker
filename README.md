Job Hunt Tracker

This is my personal job application tracker I built with Laravel + Vite. I wanted something lightweight but still powerful enough to keep track of companies, positions, and application statuses without juggling a bunch of random spreadsheets.

The app lets me:

Store and manage companies (name, website, location, etc.)

Log applications with details like role, status, salary range, date applied, and notes

Keep everything tied to my user account so it’s private and organized

Use Laravel Breeze auth for login/registration
